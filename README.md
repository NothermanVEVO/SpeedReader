A text reader made with the Godot Engine, based on the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique, where the content is displayed word by word in the same spot on the screen, allowing you to read without having to move your eyes.

Ideal for studying, training your brain, speed reading, and accessibility.
